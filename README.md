# Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vision

## What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.

## Desire for Computers to See

We are awash in images.

Smartphones have cameras, and taking a photo or video and sharing it has never been easier, resulting in the incredible growth of modern social networks like Instagram.

YouTube might be the second largest search engine and hundreds of hours of video are uploaded every minute and billions of videos are watched every day.

The internet is comprised of text and images. It is relatively straightforward to index and search text, but in order to index and search images, algorithms need to know what the images contain. For the longest time, the content of images and video has remained opaque, best described using the meta descriptions provided by the person that uploaded them.

To get the most out of image data, we need computers to “see” an image and understand the content.
This is a trivial problem for a human, even young children.

* A person can describe the content of a photograph they have seen once.
* A person can summarize a video that they have only seen once.
* A person can recognize a face that they have only seen once before.

We require at least the same capabilities from computers in order to unlock our images and videos.

## Computer Vision and Image Processing

Computer vision is distinct from image processing.

Image processing is the process of creating a new image from an existing image, typically simplifying or enhancing the content in some way. It is a type of digital signal processing and is not concerned with understanding the content of an image.

A given computer vision system may require image processing to be applied to raw input, e.g. pre-processing images.

Examples of image processing include:

* Normalizing photometric properties of the image, such as brightness or color.
* Cropping the bounds of the image, such as centering an object in a photograph.
* Removing digital noise from an image, such as digital artifacts from low light levels.

## Tasks in Computer Vision

The 2010 textbook on computer vision titled **“Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications”** provides a list of some high-level problems where we have seen success with computer vision.

* Optical character recognition (OCR)
* Machine inspection
* Retail (e.g. automated checkouts)
* 3D model building (photogrammetry)
* Medical imaging
* Automotive safety
* Match move (e.g. merging CGI with live actors in movies)
* Motion capture (mocap)
* Surveillance
* Fingerprint recognition and biometrics

Many popular computer vision applications involve trying to recognize things in photographs; for example:

* Object Classification: What broad category of object is in this photograph?
* Object Classification: What broad category of object is in this photograph?
* Object Identification: Which type of a given object is in this photograph?
* Object Verification: Is the object in the photograph?
* Object Detection: Where are the objects in the photograph?
* Object Landmark Detection: What are the key points for the object in the photograph?
* Object Segmentation: What pixels belong to the object in the image?
* Object Recognition: What objects are in this photograph and where are they?

Other common examples are related to information retrieval; for example: finding images like an image or images that contain an object.
